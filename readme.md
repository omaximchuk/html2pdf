Goal of this project
=====================

This is a research project about how to render html file with style into a valid pdf file using only java opensource libraries.

The following libraries were used:

* [Apache PDF Box](https://pdfbox.apache.org/)
* [Apache FOP](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/)
* [JOD Converter](https://code.google.com/p/jodconverter/)
* [Flying Saucer](https://code.google.com/p/flying-saucer/)

Note: to be able to compile the project all files from /lib folder should be added to classpath, the reason is the absence of JOS
Converter maven repository.
